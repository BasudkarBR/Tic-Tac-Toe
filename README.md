## Future Enhancements

- Implement a restart button.
- Add AI player option.
- For the current move only, show "You are at move #..." instead of a button.
- Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.
- Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
- When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win (and when no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw).
- Display the location for each move in the format (row, col) in the move history list.
